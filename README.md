# Dynamic-Pricing-Prediction-For-Cabs-Using-IBM-Watson

Many organizations do not have a direct role in travel and tourism but offer related products and services. Some examples would be offering travel insurance, parking facilities at airports, theatre and event tickets, car hire, and travel by rail or coach to airports, etc. at competitive rates. There are various different forms of dynamic pricing:
1. Peak Pricing – This is a strategy that is common in transportation businesses. Airlines are a good example. Airlines often charge a higher price to travel during rush hour mostly on weekdays and sometimes on weekends.
2. Surge Pricing – Companies such as Uber respond dynamically to changes in supply and demand in order to price their services differently. Like most of us have noticed, this frequently happens on stormy evenings and nights when more people request for cabs. Taxify also not so long ago introduced dynamic pricing to ensure the drivers are encouraged to go online and offer services when the demand is high.
